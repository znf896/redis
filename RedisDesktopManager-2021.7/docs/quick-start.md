# **How to start using RDM**
***


After you've [installed](install.md) RDM, the first thing you need to do in order to get going is to create a connection to your Redis server. On the main window, press the button labelled **Connect to Redis Server**. 

![](http://rdm.dev/static/docs/rdm_main.png?v=2)

## Connect to a local or public redis-server
On the first tab (Connection Settings), put in general information regarding the connection that you are creating.

* **Name** - the name of new connection (example: my_local_redis)
* **Host** - redis-server host (example: localhost)
* **Port** - redis-server port (example: 6379)
* **Password** - redis-server authentication password (if any) ([http://redis.io/commands/AUTH](http://redis.io/commands/AUTH))
* **Username** - only for redis-servers >= 6.0 with configured [ACL](https://redis.io/topics/acl), for older redis-server leave empty

## Connect to a public redis-server with SSL
If you want to connect to a redis-server instance with SSL you need to enable SSL on the second tab and provide a public key in PEM format. 
Instructions for certain cloud services are below:

### AWS ElastiCache
AWS ElastiCache is not accessible outside of your VPC. In order to connect to your ElastiCache remotely, you need to use one of the following options:

*  Setup VPN connection **[Recommended]**
[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/accessing-elasticache.html#access-from-outside-aws](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/accessing-elasticache.html#access-from-outside-aws)
*  Setup SSH proxying host and connect through SSH tunnel. **[Slow network performance. Not recommended]**
*  Setup NAT instance for exposing your AWS ElastiCache to the Internet **[Firewall rules should be configured very carefully. Not recommended.]**

#### How to connect to AWS ElastiCache with In-Transit Encryption
##### VPN / NAT
Enable SSL/TLS checkbox and connect to your AWS ElastiCache with In-Transit Encryption.

##### SSH tunnel
Click on "Enable TLS-over-SSH" checkbox in the the SSH connection settings and connect to your AWS ElastiCache with In-Transit Encryption.

### Microsoft Azure Redis Cache <br /> <img src="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/media/index/redis-cache.svg" width="100" />

1. Create a connection with all requested information.
 <br /> <img src="http://rdm.dev/static/docs/rdm_ssl_azure.png?v=2" />
2. Make sure that the "Use SSL Protocol" checkbox is enabled.
3. Your Azure Redis connection is ready to use.

### Redis Labs <br /> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Redis_Labs_Logo.png" height="75" />
To connect to a Redis Labs instance with SSL/TLS encryption, follow the steps below:

1. Make sure that SSL is enabled for your Redis instance in the Redis Labs dashboard.
2. Download and unzip `garantia_credentials.zip` from the Redis Labs dashboard.
3. Select `garantia_user.crt` in the "Public key" field.
4. Select `garantia_user_private.key` in the "Private key" field.
5. Select `garantia_ca.pem` in the "Authority" field.

### Digital Ocean Managed Redis <br /> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/DigitalOcean_logo.svg" width="100">
Digital Ocean connection settings is a bit confusing. To connect to a Digital Ocean Managed Redis you need to follow steps bellow:

1. Copy host, port and password information to RDM
2. **Leave Username field in RDM empty** (Important!)
3. Enable SSL/TLS checkbox

Or using Quick Connect tab for new connections:
1. Copy connection string (starts with "rediss://") from connection details to RDM
2. Click "Import" and "Test Connection"

### Heroku Redis <br /> <img src="https://brand.heroku.com/static/media/heroku-logo-stroke.aa0b53be.svg" width="80">

1. Get Redis connection string from terminal with command 
```
heroku config -a YOUR-APP-NAME | grep REDIS
```
or get it from Heroku website.

Example output:
```
rediss://user:password@host:port
```
2. Enter connection settings in RDM Connection dialog:
- If URL starts with `rediss` enable SSL/TLS checkbox and **uncheck** "Enable strict mode" checkbox
- Copy `user` to "Username" field
- Copy `password` to "Password" field
- Copy `host` and `port` to "Address" field in RDM

## Connect to private redis-server via SSH tunnel
### Basic SSH tunneling
SSH tab is supposed to allow you to use a SSH tunnel. It's useful if your redis-server is not publicly accessible.
To use a SSH tunnel select checkbox "Use SSH Tunnel". There are different security options; you can use a plain password or OpenSSH private key. 

>!!! note "for Windows users:" 
    Your private key must be in .pem format.

<img src="http://rdm.dev/static/docs/rdm_ssh.png?v=2" />

### Advanced SSH tunneling
If you need advanced SSH tunneling you should setup a SSH tunnel manually and connect via localhost:
```
ssh SSH_HOST -L 7000:localhost:6379
```

## Connect to a UNIX socket

RDM [doesn't support UNIX sockets](https://github.com/uglide/RedisDesktopManager/issues/1751) directly, but you can use redirecting of the local socket to the UNIX domain socket, for instance with [socat](https://sourceforge.net/projects/socat):

```
socat -v tcp-l:6379,reuseaddr,fork unix:/tmp/redis.sock
```

## Advanced connection settings
The **Advanced settings** tab allows you to customise the namespace separator and other advanced settings.

## Next steps
Now you can test a connection or create a connection right away. 

Congratulations, you've successfully connected to your Redis Server. You should see something similar to what we show below.

Click on the connection and expand keys. By clicking the right button, you can see console menu and manage your connection from there.
